# PLPBasicGitAssignment 
After creating a new repository and adding a README.md file.
Created a folder in my desktop directory
Opened windows command prompt, navigated to the created folder.
Initialized a repository with the same name as the git hub repository (git init)
Linked my local repository with the github repository (git remote add origin https://github.com/mandarii/PLPBasicGitAssignment.git)
In the local folder I created a txt document and named it gitassign.txt
In the text document i added the message "hello, git"
Committed the changes (git add gitassign.txt)
git commit -m "Add gitassign.txt with a greeting"
I pushed the changes using ( git push -u origin master)
Then i veryfied on the repository if the changes were committed.
